# Sandra Baptista Notes


ðŸ’« Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

## NOTES:

 - New file Service to be able to read better code and to use design pattern
 - Api's will used class ContractService and JobsService
 - Added error handler with try catch

## TO IMPROVE OR DO DIFFERENT:
 - Create a folder routes and create there all files reelected with API/Routes
 - Create a folder and file to be responsible for error handling
 - Changed from node to typescript and from express to nestjs. In this way, you can have Types and a structured route structure.

## DOUBTS:
 - I don't know if I understood well I applied what was requested in terms of calculations and updates 
  


 ### API'S in DOUBTS

POST /jobs/:job_id/pay - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

POST /balances/deposit/:userId - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)
